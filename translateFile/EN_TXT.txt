The query can concern one or more specific accounts, accounts with a particular identification, or a particular type. The objective of the query may be to obtain one or more types of balance. 
	The account owner can request information based on the following elements:
- account identification
- account type (this element could be used to refine the query when the account identification represents, for example, a group of accounts)
- currency of the account (this is used to refine the query when the account identification represents, for example, a group of accounts in various currencies, or when it is a multi-currency account with one single identifier)
- balance type (if not present, all balances are requested)
- balance value date (if not present in the Get message, the Return message will contain the latest available balance) 
This message will be replied to by a Return Account Nostro message. 
Note that the Get Account Nostro message does not allow the definition of output criteria (the elements that should be returned by the account servicer). Therefore, the particular agreements between the account owner and its account servicer will stipulate the default content of the Return Account Nostro message. 

 
	Return Account Nostro
	Scope
	The Nostro variant messages have been defined to cover the basic information flows between an account owner and its account servicer. 
	The Return Account Nostro message is sent by an account servicer to an account owner. 
	It is used to provide information on the balance(s) of one or more accounts that the account servicer holds for the account owner. 
	The Return Account Nostro message can be sent as a response to a related Get Account Nostro message (pull mode) or initiated by the account servicer (push mode). The push of information can take place either at prearranged times or as a warning or alarm when a problem has occurred.
Usage
	At any time during the operating hours of the system, the account owner can query the account servicer administrator to get information about the account(s) that the latter maintains for the account owner. As an example, this may be necessary in order to perform the appropriate liquidity management and the funds transfers between accounts. 
	The account owner can request information about accounts through a series of criteria, corresponding to the known information stored at the account servicer. The query can concern one or more specific accounts, accounts of a particular identification, or a particular type. The objective of the query may be to obtain one or more types of balance. 
	The account servicer may also send a Return Account Nostro message with pre-defined information, at times previously agreed with the account owner, or to warn the account owner about a particular problem that may have arisen and which needs the account owner-s attention. 
	The message from the account servicer can contain information based on the following elements:
- account identification
- account type (this is used when the account identification represents, for example, a group of accounts) 
- currency of the account (this is used when the account identification represents, for example, a group of accounts in various currencies, or when it is a multi-currency account with one single identifier)
- balance amount
- type of balance
- balance value date 
	Note that the Get Account Nostro message does not allow the defintion of output criteria (the elements that should be returned by the account servicer). Therefore, the particular agreements between the account owner and its account servicer will stipulate the default content of the Return Account Nostro message. 
	
 
	Get Transaction Nostro
	Scope
The Nostro variant messages have been defined to cover the basic information flows between an account owner and its account servicer. 
The Get Transaction Nostro message is sent by an account owner to the account servicer. 
It is used to request information about payment instructions held at the account servicer. Payment instructions are either sent by the account owner, debiting or crediting its account at the account servicer or received by the account servicer, crediting or debiting the account owner-s account.
Usage
Following normal business flows, transactions registered by the account servicer may be queued for later settlement (because of insufficient available funds, or because of risk or liquidity limits, etc). A transaction may experience a series of successive statuses. These can be transient statuses (such as pending or related types) and final statuses (such as rejected, revoked and/or settled). 
Account owners need to have information about the payments queue(s) and must have the ability to take action (that is, to cancel or modify the transaction(s) to be settled). Note, however, that actions from an account owner will always concern transactions in a transient status. 
For this reason, at any time, the account owner can query the account servicer to get information about transactions, whatever the status they are in. 
These requests will either concern all transactions, all transactions with a particular status, or a specific transaction. 
The account owner can request information about transactions through a series of criteria, corresponding to the known information stored by the account servicer. 
The account owner can request information based on the following elements:
- provenance or destination of the payment (payment to/payment from)
- transaction reference 
- payment instruction reference 
- payment instruction status, as registered by the account owner
- interbank settlement amount and/or currency
- credit/debit indicator 
- SWIFT FIN payment message used for the payment instruction
- account identification (entries booked to a specific account)
- entry amount and/or currency
- entry debit/credit indicator (if absent, all entries should be reported)
- status of the entry (pending, booked, ...)
- entry date and time
An element that is particular to the Get/Return Transaction pair is the Statement Report. When a Get Transaction Nostro message is sent requesting a statement report, the related Return Transaction Nostro message will provide a predefined set of return criteria per transaction. The information returned contains the following details of each transaction:
- value date
- entry date
- debit/credit indicator
- entry amount
- payment message type
- payment type
- entry reference
- transaction reference
- supplementary details
Note that, apart from the Statement Report element, the Get Transaction Nostro message does not allow the definition of output criteria (the elements that should be returned by the account servicer). Therefore, the particular agreements between the account owner and its account servicer will stipulate the default content of the Return Transaction Nostro message.
The Get Transaction Nostro message will be replied to by a Return Transaction Nostro message.

The account owner can request information about transactions through a series of criteria, corresponding to the known information stored by the account servicer. Based on the criteria received within the request, the account servicer will select items that will match with the request and report them to the requestor.
The account servicer may also send a Return Transaction Nostro message with pre-defined information at times previously agreed with the account owner or to warn the account owner about a particular problem that may have arisen and which needs the account owner's attention.
The message from the account servicer can contain information based on the following elements:

- currency of the account
- type of account
- entry reference
- entry date
- transfer reason
- details related to the status of the payment instruction
An element that is particular to the Get/Return Transaction pair is the Statement Report. When a Get Transaction Nostro message is sent requesting a statement report, the related Return Transaction Nostro message will provide a predefined set of return criteria per transaction. The information returned contains the following details of each tranasction:
- value date
- entry date
- debit/credit code
- entry amount
- method of payment (payment instrument or message type)
- entry reference
- transaction reference
- supplementary details
Note that, apart from the Statement Report element, the Get Transaction Nostro message does not allow the definition of output criteria (the elements that should be returned by the account servicer). Therefore, the particular agreements between the account owner and its account servicer will stipulate the default content of the Return Transaction Nostro message.
Additional information on the generic design of the Get/Return messages can be found in the section How to Use the Cash Management Messages.
